## FYI: Serialize MultiDimensional Arrays


</div>

### Description

Small updates &amp; converted to Class Module. Maybe usercontrol writers might find this useful; other than that? The attached code is a bunch of memory manipulation to convert/serialize any dimension array into a single dimensioned byte array, primarily for storage into a property bag. The routines also convert that single dimensional byte array back into the same mulitdimensional array it came from; maintaining all array attributes. I would think good knowledge of how various data types are stored by VB would be needed to fully understand the code. P.S. No screenshot because there really is nothing to show - 1 button. 13Dec06::Patched. Logic to determine if a passed string array contained fixed or variable length strings was incorrect.
